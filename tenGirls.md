Ten girls十個童女The Parable of the Ten Virgins
the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 25, Verses 1-13 (NIV):

“At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.  Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.  The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps.
The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
“At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’
“Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.
The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’
“‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’
“But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.
“Later the others also came. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door for us!’
“But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don’t know you.’
“Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour."
This parable emphasizes the importance of being prepared and vigilant for the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven.

The Story of the Ten Girls

Once, there were ten girls who wanted to go to a special party. They all had lamps to help them see at night.
Five of the girls were very smart and brought extra oil for their lamps. The other five girls did not bring extra oil.
The party was late, and everyone got sleepy. When it was finally time for the party, the lamps of the five girls without extra oil went out. They asked the smart girls for some oil, but the smart girls said, "We don't have enough for everyone. You need to get your own oil."
While the five girls without extra oil went to buy more, the party started, and the smart girls went inside. The door was closed, and when the other girls came back, they couldn't get in.
The important lesson is to always be ready, because you never know when something special might happen.
This version simplifies the story and focuses on the main lesson in a way that a young child can understand.

The story of the Ten Virgins (or Ten Girls) teaches us some important lessons:

Be Prepared: Just like the wise girls who brought extra oil, we should always be ready for important things in life. This means thinking ahead and being prepared for unexpected events.
要有準備：就像那些聰明的女孩帶了額外的油，我們應該隨時為重要的事情做好準備。這意味著要提前思考並為突發事件做好準備。

Responsibility: Each person is responsible for their own actions. The foolish girls didn't bring extra oil and had to face the consequences. It's important to make good choices and take responsibility for what we do.

Overall, the parable encourages us to be thoughtful, prepared, and responsible in our everyday lives.
智慧與遠見：聰明的女孩展示了智慧和遠見，為未來做好了準備。我們也應該學會這樣，在做決定時考慮長遠的影響，並為未來做好準備。
